### HR Interview Chatbot 
This project is a Human Resources (HR) interview chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLM), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and a vector database to assist job seekers in preparing for behavior interviews. The chatbot analyzes job descriptions to generate tailored interview questions using the RAG technique, gives ratings to the answers to questions, and provides answers to common interview queries. The application is developed using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web apps with minimal effort.
Features:
- Generates personalized interview questions based on the job description.
- Used a question-answer source for faster retrieval.
- Provides answers to common interview questions.
- Gives a rating to the answers to the questions.
- Enables users to practice interview scenarios as if conversing with an actual interviewer because of the voice assistant.
Usage:
To use the chatbot, users simply run the Streamlit app and follow the prompts to describe the job description. They can then engage with the chatbot to prepare for their upcoming interviews.
Future Work:
The project's future goals include optimizing the chatbot's speed, enhancing the front end, and addressing limitations such as topic deviations.
Limitations:
The chatbot may exhibit "hallucinations" or deviations from the topic. It is important to note that the chatbot is not a substitute for professional interview preparation and is intended for educational and informational purposes only.
Contributing:
The project welcomes contributions, suggestions for improvement, and bug fixes. Users are encouraged to create pull requests or open issues to enhance the functionality and reliability of the chatbot.
This HR interview chatbot project provides a valuable tool for job seekers to practice and prepare for interviews, leveraging advanced language models and a user-friendly interface through Streamlit.
